    <h3>Description of the Dish</h3>
    <p>
        A classic steamed bun with a savory lentil stuffing <em>or even poppy seeds ;)</em>, 
        this Himachali Siddu is best served warm with ghee, during cold winters!
    </p>

    <p>
        Most popular in the hilly regions of Shimla, <strong>Kullu</strong>, and Manali in 
        Northern India, Himachali Siddu is made with a savory filling. Traditionally, you 
        make a dough with flour (refined flour or whole-wheat flour), instant yeast, salt, 
        sugar, and water. The savory stuffing is made with urad dal (split black gram), cooked
        with some basic spices and aromatics, while the sweet stuffing can vary from mixed 
        nuts to poppy seeds.

    <h3>Ingredients for the Recipe:</h3>
    <h5>For the Filling</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup split Urad Dal (split black gram)</li>
        <li>1 inch Ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp Cooking Oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp Cumin Seeds (jeera)</li>
        <li>1 small Onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Turmeric Powder (haldi)</li>
        <li>1 tsp Coriander Powder (or any spice you like)</li>
        <li>2 cups Water</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For the Dough</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Whole-wheat flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp Sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Oil or Ghee</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Warm Water</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps and Instructions:</h3>
    <h5>For the Filling- Basic Prep</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and soak the urad dal in water for 4-5 hours until the dal plumps up. 
            Discard the water completely.</li>
        <li>Add the Dal to a blender along with the chili, ginger, turmeric powder, 
            salt and any other spices you want.</li>
        <li>Without adding too much water, grind to a thick paste, and set aside.</li>    
    </ol>

    <h5>For the Filling:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix onion and oil with the dal paste. Taste and adjust for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add to a steamer plate and steam for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>When cool, add the cilantro leaves, mix well and set aside.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>For the Dough:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together the flour, salt, sugar, instant yeast and warm ghee or oil.</li>
        <li>Add the warm water and mix until the mixture comes together. Knead for 
            7-8 minutes until you have a smooth and soft dough.</li>
        <li>Place in a large oiled bowl. Cover with a damp cloth or lid. Let it 
            rest in a warm spot for 1-2 hours or until the mixture doubles or triples 
            in volume.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Making Siddu:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide dough into equal portions, and roll into neat balls. You can make one 
            large siddu, cut into pieces and serve for ease, or you can make smaller, 
            individual sized portions too.</li>
        <li>Divide the filling into portions and roll into balls too. This will ease the 
            process of forming the buns.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough into a 1/2-inch thick circle. Place some of the filling on one 
            side of the circle, leave some gap on the edge. Fold over the other half onto 
            the half with the stuffing. Seal the edges. Make a patter with a fork if 
            desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Cooking the Siddu:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>If you have a steamer, place the formed siddu on it. Cover & rest for 20 
            minutes.</li>
        <li>If you don't have a steamer: Place the siddu on a plate lined with parchment 
            paper. Bring some water to a boil in a pot, and place something on the bottom 
            to raise the surface. Then place the plate with the siddu in the pan. This is 
            a make-shift steamer for you. Close with a lid.</li>
        <li>Steam for 8-10 minutes or until the dough is fully cooked through. Insert a 
            knife or tooth pick into one siddu, and if it comes out clean, it is done.</li>
        <li>Allow it to rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then remove the siddu and store in an 
            airtoght container.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Serving the Siddu:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Siddu has to be served warm. So even if you make this ahead of time, steam it 
            for a couple of minutes to reheat before serving again.</li>
        <li>Serve the Siddu with warm, liquidy Ghee and any chutney or condiment you like.</li>
    </ol>
